            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
            Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
            its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
            opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
            will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
            accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

            But I must explain to you how all <a href="DexièmePage.html" target="_blank"> VEIULLEZ CLIQUEZ ICI</a> POUR PASSER VOTRE COMMANDE this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
